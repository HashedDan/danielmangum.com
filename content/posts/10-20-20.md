I joined [Scott Lowe](https://twitter.com/scott_lowe) on the [Full Stack Journey](https://packetpushers.net/series/full-stack-journey/) podcast for a chat about how [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) enables you to provision infrastructure from your Kubernetes cluster and allows you to compose abstractions that define your own PaaS. You can listen [here](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/full-stack-journey-047-using-kubernetes-and-crossplane-to-provision-cloud-infrastructure/).
