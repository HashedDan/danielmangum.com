Though there are numerous examples of companies that are moving from traditional batch ETL processes to a streaming architecture, there is still a need to develop "jobs" that transform data moving from a source to a consumer. These jobs are fundamentally different than application code that is usually managed by git workflows, and thus should be managed in a way that reflects how it is used.

Matillion represents jobs in the form of JSON files.
