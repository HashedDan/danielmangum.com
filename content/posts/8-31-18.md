Two of the most prominent sorting algorithms used in computer programming are *merge sort* and *quick sort*. While the performance appears to be rather similar for these alogrithms, there are specific scenarios in which one is superior to the other.

# Run Time Complexity

The most commonly referenced metric when evaluating algorithms (and for good reason) is the run time. Usually you evaluate the best, worst, and average case for the run time.

Both of the algorithms we are discussing today are excellent (relative to other sorting algorithms) in terms of run time. This is one of the major reasons they are so widely employed. However, we will see that though they have the same average run time, one can be more performant than the other depending on the scenario.
