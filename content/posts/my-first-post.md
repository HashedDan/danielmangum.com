I have always been envious of developers who share valuable information on their blog. I have thought for a long time that I wanted to be one of those developers that became famous in programming circles for the insight they shared. However, this also led me to be intimidated by the idea of writing my own posts. How could I ever measure up to these developers?

That mindset changed when I realized how much I had benefitted in work, school, and on personal projects from the blog posts of developers. It dawned on me that letting my own insecurity get in the way of writing could actively be hindering someone who was stuck on a problem. When framed in this manner, the pressure to produce something extraordinary is lessened because you are not writing for your own gain. You are writing to help others just like so many have done for you.

If this only helps one person it will be worth it.
