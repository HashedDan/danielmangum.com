If you are moving to a microservices architecture (or even if you are not), you are most likely familiar with at least one of Hashicorp's products. Today we are going to focus on three of the company's products: Terraform, Consul, and Nomad. This post will simply detail how to setup the cluster, but there will be further posts discussing how to use its capabilities and how to structure your clusters based on your use case.

## A Brief Overview of Each Product

[**Terraform**](https://www.terraform.io/)

We will use Terraform to design our infrastructure and automatically provision our server and client nodes. It will allow us to easily create, destroy, and iterate upon our cloud architecture.

[**Consul**](https://www.consul.io/)

In the era of microservices, the concept of *service discovery* has become vitally important. If a monolithic application is to be broken down into many small services, they must be able to find and communicate with each other. Consul also allows us automatically bootstrap our Nomad cluster.

[**Nomad**](https://www.nomadproject.io/)

Once our infrastructure is provisioned by Terraform, Nomad allows us to manage it. This includes deploying, scheduling, upgrading, monitoring, and scaling applications of any kind. A good way to think of it is a less opiononated Kubernetes.

## Let's Get Started

*Note: This post assumes that you have already isntalled Terraform on your local machine.*

For this guide, we will be using Google Cloud becuase of their generous free credits for new users. The first thing you need to do is go to the [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) page and setup a new account by clicking Try Free.

Next, you will need to setup a new project from the Google Cloud Console. Name it whatever you like.

Lastly, we need to setup the Google Cloud SDK so that we can interact with our project from the command line. Follow this [link](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts) to find the quickstart guide for your operating system. Make sure to select the project you created when prompted.

Now we are ready to start provisioning our infrastructure!

## Building the Modules

If you are not familiar with Terraform, it uses the concept of modules to build up an infrastructure. While there are many existing Google Cloud Terraform modules already on Github, we are going to build ours from the ground up to show how Terraform works.

Let's begin by creating a directory structure for our project:

```
/ gcp-consul-nomad
    / modules
        / cluster
    / scripts
```

In our top-level directory (gcp-consul-nomad), we will build our main Terraform configuration, making use of the modules and scripts defined in their respective directories.

**The Server / Client Model**

Both Consul and Nomad use a Server / Client structure where the servers orchestrate the clients. For this post, we will be building a cluster of 3 Consul / Nomad servers, and a cluster of 2 Consul / Nomad clients. What this means is that we will provision a total of 5 compute instances, 3 of which will be running the Consul and Nomad binaries in server mode, and 2 of which will be running the Consul and Nomad binaries in client mode.

Let's start with building out the ```cluster```. Navigate to the directory and create the following two files: ```main.tf``` and ```variables.tf```.
