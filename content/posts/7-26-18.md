# Introduction to Kong API Gateway with Go Web Server
This guide will teach you how to run the Kong API gateway locally as a proxy server for a Golang API using Docker.

## The Go API

The Golang standard library has a very simple http library that makes it very easy to spin up a web server. For now, we will build the simplest implementation of a web server. Start by creating a new directory in your go/src/.

```mkdir go-api && cd $_```

Then create a new file main.go.

```touch main.go```

And copy the following snippet into it:

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "This is an endpoint.")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/test", handler)
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

This simple API has one endpoint and will serve on port 8080.

While we are here, we can go ahead and create a very simple Dockerfile to run our web server in a container:

```touch Dockerfile```

And the contents:
```
FROM golang:onbuild
EXPOSE 8080
```
We will move on to setting up the Kong server, but will come back to this when it is up and running.

## The Kong Server

Our next task is setting up the Kong server. We will use Docker to run the Kong image as well as a Cassandra database image. The first step is setting up a Docker network:

```docker network create kong-net```

Then we can run our Cassandra container:
```
docker run d --name kong-database /

--network=kong-net /

-p 9042:9042 /

cassandra:3
```
And apply the database migrations to it:
```
docker run --rm /

--network=knog-net /

-e "KONG_DATABASE=cassandra" /

-e "KONG_PG_HOST=kong-database" /

-e "KONG_CASSANDRA_CONTACT_POINTS=kong-database" /

kong:latest kong migrations up
```
Lastly, we will start the Kong server:
```
docker run -d --name kong /

--network=kong-net /

-e "KONG_DATABASE=cassandra" /

-e "KONG_PG_HOST=kong-database" /

-e "KONG_CASSANDRA_CONTACT_POINTS=kong-database" /

-e "KONG_PROXY_ACCESS_LOG=/dev/stdout" /

-e "KONG_ADMIN_ACCESS_LOG=/dev/stdout" /

-e "KONG_PROXY_ERROR_LOG=/dev/stderr" /

-e "KONG_ADMIN_ERROR_LOG=/dev/stderr" /

-e "KONG_ADMIN_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:8001, 0.0.0.0:8444 ssl" /

-p 8080:8080 /

-p 8443:8443 /

-p 8001:8001 /

-p 8444:8444 /

kong:latest
```
Now, to verify that the Kong server is up and running and has connected to the Cassandra container, we can use curl to query the Kong Admin API:

```curl -i http://localhost:8001/```

If connection was successful, you should receive an HTTP 200 OK response.
