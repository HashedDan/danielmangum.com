In another life, I was twice as big as I am now and played inside linebacker on a nationally ranked high school football team (this sounds much more impressive than it was in reality). I had a terrific position coach at the time who was foundational in teaching us the fundamentals of the game. He had one phrase that he would always repeat: "A thousand tiny steps".

As I have transitioned to working on open source software full-time, I have found this maxim echoing in my head.
