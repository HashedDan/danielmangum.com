If you keep up with the Golang community, you may have heard about the release of the Go Cloud API on [July 24th](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/google-wants-go-to-become-the-go-to-language-for-writing-cloud-apps/). While Go is already used for many cloud applications, it largely has to be catered to the cloud platform of choice. Now with a standard way to interact with cloud providers, developers can write code once that can run on any cloud (*Note: Currently only support for AWS and GCP with plans to expand to others*).

## What can Go Cloud do for you?

### Blob Storage



### Config Variables
