If you follow me anywhere on the internet, you likely have seen me mention Crossplane (probably more times than you would like). I recently went back to the city I grew up in and my mom asked me what I was working on these days. To someone who does not work in infrastructure software, it can be difficult to grasp exactly what the project accomplishes, but through numerous conversations with people outside of the industry, I have begun to develop a few metaphorical examples that virtually anyone can relate to. One that is particularly useful was proposed to me by one of my coworkers recently: Crossplane is to cloud providers as Google flights is to airlines. Allow me to explain...

## Cloud Providers as Airlines

Most commerical airlines provide a roughly similar experience. In fact, you are usually flying on the exact same airplane with a different decal on the side. Imagine the airplane as servers in a datacenter. They are mostly the same or very similar in terms of raw functionality, but may have a different feature set exposed. Similarly, an airplane may have the same engine and hull, but might include features such as individual TV screens, in-flight wifi, or food and beverage options.
