Running your own machines has become an antiquated practice. Almost all companies have migrated at least some of their architecture to a cloud provider (i.e. AWS, GCP, Azure). There are many advantages of utilizing a cloud provider, but there are also drawbacks. You are forced to access your machines through an API or UI that the provider has created. You may not know if or why a machine has gone down. With this new model of architecture, new solutions have also had to be developed to address new problems.
