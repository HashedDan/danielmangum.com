Running your own machines has become an antiquated practice. Almost all companies have migrated at least some of their architecture to a cloud provider (i.e. AWS, GCP, Azure). There are many advantages of utilizing a cloud provider, but there are also drawbacks. You are forced to access your machines through an API or UI that the provider has created. You may not know if or why a machine has gone down. With this new model of architecture, new solutions have also had to be developed to address new problems.

One of the biggest problems with using a cloud provider is the lock-in effect. Once you choose one and design your deployment strategy around it, it becomes very difficult to switch. Furthermore, outages with a single provider can bring all of your instances down in one fell swoop. So the goal becomes automating your deployments, while not being married to one cloud.

Fortunately there are multiple tools that have been developed to address this issue. One of these tools is Terraform, which is developed by Hashicorp.
