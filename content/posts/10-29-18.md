A student organization I am part of at Washington University in St. Louis decided it would be fun to play a giant game of Assassins on campus this Fall. If you are not familiar with the game, you start with a group of people, then assign a each person a target that they must "assassinate". Upon doing so, they are then assigned their target's target, and so on. We expanded that game further such that the 10 days the game lasted for where divided into 4 time periods, and each person was required to get at least 1 kill each period to continue to the next round.

When designing the game, it became apparent that it would be useful to have a simple Assassins portal where participants could see who their target is and how much time they had to kill them.

## Choosing Our Tech

My roommate ([Owen Auch](https://github.com/owenauch)) and I didn't have much time to get it done before the beginning of the game, so we made a quick assessment of the technologies we would use based on the following criteria:

- [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) : I still had some credits remaining from the generous free trial that Google Cloud provides, and App Engine allows you to deploy API's / Web Apps in a simple, Heroku-like CLI.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) : Owen is a seasoned React veteran and I have also used it more regularly than any other front end framework, so it was an easy choice for our SPA.
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) : Our API would be very simple, and using Express with Node allows you to write a simple API in just a few lines of code.
- [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) : While I would never use this in production for a secure application or API, it was very useful for allowing us to create a free database using Google Sheets that was extremely easy to update for us and any of our less technical counterparts. 


## How We Did It

Because Owen would be participating in the game, the back end needed to be completely separate from the front end. I would build a simple API that he could query from his React App, as opposed to him using Tabletop directly. This also allowed him not to worry about filtering or sanitizing the data returned.

I started by creating a new Google Sheets document. This would define our schema and house all of our data. Tabletop works by simply reading the top row of the sheet for column names, and then processing the the following rows accordingly.
