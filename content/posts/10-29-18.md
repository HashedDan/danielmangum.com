A student organization I am part of at Washington University in St. Louis decided it would be fun to play a giant game of Assassins on campus this Fall. If you are not familiar with the game, you start with a group of people, then assign a each person a target that they must "assassinate". Upon doing so, they are then assigned their target's target, and so on. We expanded that game further such that the 10 days the game lasted for where divided into 4 time periods, and each person was required to get at least 1 kill each period to continue to the next round.

When designing the game, it became apparent that it would be useful to have a simple Assassins portal where participants to see who their target is and how much time they had to kill them.
